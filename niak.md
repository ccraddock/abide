#The NeuroImaging Analysis Kit (NIAK)

**The NIAK is a free and open-source software developed since 2008 for the preprocessing and data mining of large functional neuroimaging samples. It is compatible with both the GNU Octave[^1] and Matlab[^2] languages. It has a single dependency on the MINC tools[^3]. The implementation of tools in NIAK is modular, and the integration of several tools into complex multistep processing "pipelines" is achieved using a framework called the Pipeline System for Octave and Matlab (PSOM) (Bellec et al. 2012)[^4]. In particular, thanks to PSOM, NIAK pipelines can be executed using parallel resources in high-performance computing environments.**

The ABIDE sample was preprocessed using the NIAK release 0.7.1 (Bellec et al. HBM 2011, NIAK website)[^5]. 

No volumes were suppressed at the beginning of each functional run and no correction was applied for inter-slice difference in acquisition time. A single non-uniformity field was estimated based on the median volume of each functional run using the N3 method[^6], and applied to all volumes in the run. 

The parameters of a rigid-body motion was estimated for each time frame using the median volume of the run as a target. The median fMRI volume was was also coregistered with a T1 individual scan using Minctracc (Collins et al. 1997)[^7], which was itself non-linearly transformed to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (Fonov et al 2011)[^8] using the CIVET pipeline (Zijdenbos et al. 2002)[^9]. The MNI asymmetric template was generated from the ICBM152 sample of 152 young adults, after 40 iterations of non-linear coregistration. The rigid-body transform, fMRI-to-T1 transform and T1-to-stereotaxic transform were all combined, and the functional volumes were resampled in the MNI space at a 3 mm isotropic resolution. 

The “scrubbing” method of Power et al. 2012[^10], was used to remove the volumes with excessive motion (frame displacement greater than 0.5). The following nuisance parameters were regressed out from the time series at each voxel: slow time drifts (basis of discrete cosines with a 0.01 Hz high-pass cut-off), average signals in conservative masks of the white matter and the lateral ventricles as well as the first principal components (95\% energy) of the six rigid-body motion parameters and their squares (Lund et al. 2001, Giove et al. 2009)[^11]'[^12]. 

The fMRI volumes were finally spatially smoothed with a 6 mm isotropic Gaussian blurring kernel. A more detailed description of the pipeline can be found on the NIAK website[^5].
