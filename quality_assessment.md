# QA

Here we detail the quality assessment (QA) columns given in the phenotypic file. There are automated metrics provided with columns having the prefix `anat_` or `func_`. There are also manual quality assessment of the data by three raters with columns having the prefix `qc_`.

## Automated QA

These columns reflect automated metrics with descriptions given further down. To determine outliers one might use 1.5x or 3x the inter-quartile range (IQR). Here, we provide a list of the columns for automated anatomical or functional quality assessment. 

**Anatomical**

* anat_cnr
* anat_efc
* anat_fber
* anat_fwhm
* anat_qi1
* anat_snr

**Functional**

* func_efc
* func_fber
* func_fwhm
* func_dvars
* func_outlier
* func_quality
* func_mean_fd
* func_num_fd
* func_perc_fd
* func_gsr


### Anatomical

For each point below, we will describe a given measure via the following format: "Measure - Column: Summary"

* **Contrast to Noise Ratio [anat_cnr]:** Calculated as the mean of the gray matter values minus the mean of the white matter values, divided by the standard deviation of the air values [^1].
* **Entopy Focus Criterion [anat_efc]:** Shannon’s entropy is used to summarize the principal directions distribution, higher energy indicating the distribution is more uniform (i.e., less noisy) [^2].
* **Foreground to Background Energy Ratio [anat_fber]:** Mean energy of image values (i.e., mean of squares) within the head relative to outside the head.
* **Smoothness of Voxels [anat_fwhm]:** The full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the spatial distribution of the image intensity values [^3].
* **Artifact Detection [anat_qi1]:** The proportion of voxels with intensity corrupted by artifacts normalized by the number of voxels in the background [^4].
* **Signal-to-Noise Ratio [anat_snr]:** The mean of image values within gray matter divided by the standard deviation of the image values within air (i.e., outside the head) [^1].


### Functional

Note that some metrics quantify the quality of the data in the spatial domain (columns: func_efc, func_fber, func_fwhm, and func_gsr) and use the mean functional image for this purpose. Other metrics quantify the quality of the data in the temporal domain (columns: func_dvars, func_outlier, func_quality, func_mean_fd, func_num_fd, and func_perc_fd) and use the voxelwise time-series functional data.

* **Entopy Focus Criterion [func_efc]:** Shannon’s entropy is used to summarize the principal directions distribution, higher energy indicating the distribution is more uniform (i.e., less noisy) [^2]. _Uses mean functional._
* **Foreground to Background Energy Ratio [func_fber]:** Mean energy of image values (i.e., mean of squares) within the head relative to outside the head. _Uses mean functional._
* **Smoothness of Voxels [func_fwhm]:** The full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the spatial distribution of the image intensity values. _Uses mean functional._
* **Standardized DVARS [func_dvars]:** The spatial standard deviation of the temporal derivative of the data, normalized by the temporal standard deviation and temporal autocorrelation [^5][^6]. _Uses functional time-series._
* **Outlier Detection [func_outlier]:** The mean fraction of outliers found in each volume using 3dTout command in AFNI (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni) [^7]. _Uses functional time-series._
* **Median Distance Index [func_quality]:** The mean distance (1 – spearman’s rho) between each time-point's volume and the median volume using AFNI’s 3dTqual command (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni) [^7]. _Uses functional time-series._
* **Mean Fractional Displacement - Jenkinson [func_mean_fd]:** A measure of subject head motion, which compares the motion between the current and previous volumes. This is calculated by summing the absolute value of displacement changes in the x, y and z directions and rotational changes about those three axes. The rotational changes are given distance values based on the changes across the surface of a 50mm radius sphere [^5][^8]. _Uses functional time-series._
* **Number of volumes with FD greater than 0.2mm [func_num_fd]:** _Uses functional time-series._
* **Percent of volumes with FD greater than 0.2mm [func_perc_fd]:** _Uses functional time-series._
* **Ghost to Signal Ratio [func_gsr]:** A measure of the mean signal in the ‘ghost’ image (signal present outside the brain due to acquisition in the phase encoding direction) relative to mean signal within the brain. _Uses mean functional._


## Manual QA

Manual inspection of the data was carried out by three independent raters. Rater 1 examined the general quality of the data focusing on the preprocessed functional data and derivatives. Raters 2-3 examined the quality of the raw anatomical and functional data. Ratings are given as OK and fail for raters 1 and 3, and OK, maybe, and fail for rater 2. Each rater also may have taken notes related to their ratings, thus there is a notes column associated with each rating column.
